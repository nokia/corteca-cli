# Application settings
# --------------------
# These will be defined per project scope. Any modifications you make to the
# global app settings will be picked up as defaults when creating a new
# application.
#
# app:
#     lang: <lang-template>       # an application template name
#     title: <application-title>  # an application title (will be used for Corteca cloud metadata)
#     name: <test-app>            # single word identifier which cannot contain
#                                 # spaces (will be used for artifact naming)
#     author: <author>            # application author (will be used for Corteca cloud metadata)
#     description: |
#       <application description> # multiline description (will be used for Corteca cloud metadata)
#     version: <version>          # application version (will be used for Corteca cloud metadata)
#     duid: <DUID>                # will be generated automatically from FQDN,
#                                 # and will be used to uniquely identify the application
#     options: {}                 # template specific options


# Toolchain settings
# ------------------
# Build toolchain settings; these must exist in the system docker cache under
# the name specifed by the 'image' field below. Perform a `docker pull <image>`
# and optionally a `docker tag <old-name> <new-name>` to name your images appropriately.
build:
    # available toolchain (target) images
    # must contain entries in the form:
    #   <toolchain-alias>:
    #     image: <docker-image-name>
    #     configFile: <buildroot config file>
    toolchains:
        armv7:
            image: ghcr.io/nokia/corteca-toolchain-armv7:23.12.1
        armv8:
            image: ghcr.io/nokia/corteca-toolchain-armv8:23.12.1
    # default toolchain to use when building if none specifed
    default: armv8
    options:
    # Do not inherit variables from the host environment (proxies etc)
    # skipHostEnv: false
        env:
        # Specify custom variables inside build environment
        # <name>: <value>


# Deploy settings
# ---------------
# Specify the commands to use when deploying an application artifact to a device
deploy:
    # a sequence (array) of commands that will be executed on the device; if
    # any command fails, sequence will be interrupted
    # TODO: document the available context variables
    sequence:
        # each entry must be in the form of:
        # - cmd: <command to execute>
        #   retries: <number>         # how many times to retry the cmd in case of failure
        #   delay: <milliseconds>     # delay before next command or retry
        #   expectedOutput: <output>  # if provided, return output of cmd will be compared with this
        #                             # value; if the don't match cmd will be considered failed
    # filename of deploy logs (for SSH)
    logFile: .deploy.log


# Publish targets (endpoints)
# ---------------------------
# Specify a set of endpoints where the application can be published (to be downloaded from)
# each entry must be in the form of:
#   <alias>:
#       method: <method>    # one of `listen`, `put`, `copy`
#       addr: <url>         # url of endpoint
#       auth: <type>        # authentication type; one of `basic`, `bearer`, `password`
#       token: <auth-token> # authentication token for `bearer` authentication
publish:
    local:
        addr: http://0.0.0.0:8080
        method: listen
#   webserver:
#       addr: https://upload.example.com/artifacts/
#       auth: basic
#       method: put


# Devices
# -------
# A set of devices to deploy the application artifact(s)
# each entry must be in the form of:
#   <alias>:
#       addr: <url>                         # url of device console (only `ssh` protocol is currently supported)
#       auth: <type>                        # authentication type; one of `password`, `publicKey`
#       privateKeyFile: <path/to/file/name> # path to keyfile for private key authentication
#       source:
#           publish: <alias>                # an alias to a target (see above) to publish the artifacts before deployment
#           url: <public-url>               # the public url to download the artifact(s) from inside the device
